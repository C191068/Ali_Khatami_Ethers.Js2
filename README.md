Figure1: This is the git and node.js version that I am using<br>

Here we gonna learn how to deploy and interact with contract using ethers.js package

Figure2: here we create a new folder using the command ```mkdir``` <br>

Figure3: then it is created <br>

Figure4: when we write this command ```code akrkethers-simple-storage/``` a new vs code window will open<br>

Figure5: it is shown in the figure above <br>

 Figure6: to crate file we type the the above command, error will come but file will be created


Javascript and node.js are slightly different <br>

Node.js allow us to run javascript code at backend opposed to running javascript code at frontend <br>

Javascript is made to be a browser run language like running inside of Chrome, firefox, brave etc <br>

The syntax of backend javascript, frontend javacript and node.js are different <br>

```Typescript``` is known as a statically typed version of javascript <br>

```Typescript``` actually catches bug early on making it a lot easier to code our projects in the long run <br>

Figure7: We create a new solidity file known as ```akrkSimplestorage.sol```

Figure8: we paste the code here above <br>

Figure9: when such white circle appears it means that the file is not saved

Figure10: Going to the ```File``` and click ```save``` and it will be saved or ```Ctrl+S```
